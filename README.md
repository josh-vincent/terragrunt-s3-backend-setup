#Terragrunt S3 Backend setup 

This is for configuring s3 Backend with the following structure 

```terraform
Project
├── account-name
│   └── main.tf
│   └── providers.tf
│   └── terraform.tfvars
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   └── variables.tf
│  
└── terragrunt.hcl
```

## Parent `terragrunt.hcl` file
this file includes all the config for your state management. It needs to be updated with your bucket name for your project. 
```terraform
# stage/terragrunt.hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
  config = {
    #this is the name of the s3 Bucket where your state will be stored,
    #is the same as the bucket name in providers.tf
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-random-uuid-to-make-unique-000"

    key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-southeast-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
  }
}
```

## Child `account-name/terragrunt.hcl`
Each folder you have under the project will need its own `terragrunt.hcl` file. In this file it just needs this code 
```terraform
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

## Aws Single Sign On
If you are using AWS sso, you will have to run 
- `aws sso configure` follow the steps and setup your credentials 
- `aws sso login --profile PROFILE_NAME_HERE` sign in with the profile you have just setup

## Setting up S3 Bucket 

- First navigate into you folder `cd account-name`
- Then run `terragrunt init`

At this point you should get this in your console
```
Remote state S3 bucket my-terraform-state-random-uuid-to-make-unique-000 does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)
```
- select `y`
- This will create a new file at `account-name/backend.tf`
```terraform
# Generated by Terragrunt. Sig: nIlQXj57tbuaRZEa
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-random-uuid-to-make-unique-000"
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
    encrypt        = true
    key            = "account-name/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-southeast-2"
  }
}
```

- `terragrunt init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`

Now you should have an s3 bucket with your state managed in it also with a dynamodb table.
